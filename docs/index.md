# Identity Atlas

**Permissions are scattered across dozens of systems. You can't see who really has access to what, who used it last, or which identities were never reviewed.**

Most organizations operate with authorization data siloed in Active Directory, Entra ID, SAP, SharePoint, DevOps, and a dozen more systems — each with its own data model, no shared history, and no way to answer the question _"what can this person actually do?"_

Identity Atlas solves this by pulling authorization data from every connected system into a unified PostgreSQL data model with full audit history. It runs as a Docker stack and provides a role mining web UI for analysts and LLM-assisted risk scoring for security teams — all configurable from the browser.

## Three Core Capabilities

### Unified Data Model

Every system's permissions land in the same schema: **Systems → Resources → ResourceAssignments → Principals**. Business roles, directory roles, app roles, SharePoint site permissions, and SAP authorizations all map to the same tables.

- Audit triggers capture the full change history — query any table's changes over time via the shared `_history` table
- Data from Entra ID syncs via the Microsoft Graph API; any other system imports via CSV
- Schema evolves automatically as new attributes appear; no manual migrations needed

### Role Mining UI

A React web application bundled into the Docker stack gives analysts an interactive permission matrix, entity detail pages, and governance dashboards.

- **Permission Matrix**: rows are users/principals, columns are business roles — colored by access package or governed assignment, with direct/indirect/eligible membership badges
- **Entity Detail Pages**: click any user, group, resource, or business role to see all attributes, current memberships, and a version history diff
- **Certifications and Reviews**: track access review decisions, approval timelines, and pending requests
- **IST vs SOLL**: filter the matrix to show unmanaged (IST) or governed (SOLL) assignments

### Identity Risk Scoring

A 4-layer scoring engine that classifies principals by risk without sending sensitive identity data to any external service.

- **Phase 1 (LLM-assisted)**: discovers organizational context from public domain information only — no identity data leaves your environment
- **Phase 2 (local)**: generates industry-specific regex classifiers tuned to your organization
- **Phase 3 (local)**: scores every principal via direct match → membership analysis → structural hygiene → cross-entity propagation
- **AI agent detection**: automatically identifies Copilot Studio agents, managed identities, workload identities, and other non-human principals
- **Analyst overrides**: humans-in-the-loop score adjustments (−50 to +50) with mandatory reasoning, stored with full audit trail

## Supported Source Systems

| System | How it connects | What it syncs |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Entra ID / Azure AD** | Microsoft Graph API (service principal) | Users, groups, directory roles, app roles, business roles (access packages), PIM eligibility, access reviews |
| **Omada Identity** | CSV export | Business roles, governed assignments, certifications |
| **SailPoint** | CSV export | Access profiles, entitlements, access requests, certifications |
| **SAP / Pathlock** | CSV export | Roles, authorizations, principals |
| **SharePoint** | CSV export | Site permissions, resource assignments |
| **Any system** | CSV import via the CSV crawler | Systems, principals, resources, assignments, identities, certifications |

!!! note "Entra ID is the reference implementation"
    The Graph API connector is the most feature-complete integration and is the primary path for Microsoft 365 environments. All other systems use the CSV import path, which supports the same unified data model.

## Quick Install

**Prerequisite:** Docker.

```bash
# Download the production compose file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fortigi/IdentityAtlas/main/docker-compose.prod.yml

# Start the stack
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) → click **"Load Demo Data"** for instant gratification, or **"Connect Entra ID"** to wire up your own tenant via the in-browser wizard.
