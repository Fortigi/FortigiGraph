# Identity Atlas (FortigiGraph)

> Universal authorization intelligence — sync, analyze, and govern permissions from any identity system.

Permissions are scattered across identity systems, directories, and SaaS platforms. Identity Atlas syncs them all into a unified PostgreSQL model with trigger-based audit history, surfaces access gaps and risks through a visual role mining UI, and adds LLM-assisted identity risk scoring — without sending sensitive identity data to any external service. Source systems include Entra ID, Omada, SailPoint, SAP/Pathlock, SharePoint, Azure RBAC, Azure DevOps, or any system that can produce a CSV export.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
# 1. Download the production compose file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fortigi/IdentityAtlas/main/docker-compose.prod.yml

# 2. Start the stack
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# 3. Open http://localhost:3001
#    Click "Load Demo Data" to explore with sample data, or
#    go to Admin > Crawlers > Add Crawler to connect your Entra ID tenant.
```

The in-browser crawler wizard walks you through credentials, permission validation, object type selection, and scheduling — no PowerShell or command-line setup required.

## What Identity Atlas Does

### Unified Permission Model
- Stores permissions from any system in a single PostgreSQL schema: Systems, Resources, Principals, ResourceAssignments, ResourceRelationships
- Trigger-based audit history tracks every change as JSONB snapshots in a shared `_history` table
- Business roles, governed assignments, and resource grants share the same tables as direct permissions

### Role Mining UI
- Visual permission matrix with IST/SOLL comparison (actual vs governed access)
- Business role management with category-based column grouping and multi-type membership badges
- Entity detail pages for users, groups, and business roles with full version history
- Excel export, drag-and-drop row reordering, and server-side scaling for large environments

### Identity Risk Scoring
- LLM-assisted organizational profiling and classifier generation (public context only — no identity data sent externally)
- Multi-provider LLM support: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, and Azure OpenAI
- Four-layer scoring: direct classifier match, membership analysis, structural hygiene, cross-entity propagation
- Risk tiers from Critical (90-100) to None (0), with analyst override controls and full audit trail

### Multi-System Governance
- Native sync for Entra ID (users, groups, PIM, access packages, app roles, directory roles)
- CSV-based import for any other system (Omada, SailPoint, SAP/Pathlock, SharePoint, Azure RBAC, DevOps)
- Ingest API for building custom crawlers in any language

## Supported Source Systems

| System | Sync Method | What Gets Synced |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Entra ID / Azure AD | Built-in Graph API sync | Users, groups, PIM eligibility, app roles, directory roles, access packages, access reviews |
| Omada, SailPoint, SAP/Pathlock | CSV import | Business roles, role assignments, certifications, policies |
| SharePoint, Azure RBAC, DevOps | CSV import | Resources, resource assignments, resource relationships |
| Any system | CSV import or Ingest API | Principals, resources, assignments — any authorization data |

## PowerShell SDK

The FortigiGraph PowerShell module is available separately for users who want to interact with Microsoft Graph API directly or run crawlers outside Docker.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name FortigiGraph -Scope CurrentUser
```

See [tools/powershell-sdk/](tools/powershell-sdk/) for the Graph API wrapper functions.
